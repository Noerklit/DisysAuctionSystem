**How to run our program**

Stay in headfolder

Run 2+ systems by running the command:
go run .\server\ -name "{wanted servername}"

Then run 2+ clients by running the command:
go run .\client\ -name "{wanted clientname}"

You should now be able to write messages in the clients terminals and get output from both client and server
To assert the system runs with a crash failure close one of the systems by using ctrl + c on a server terminal
